# morse_code_transmitter_on_FPGA
 Developed using Xilinx ISE and VHDL, this project involved creating a Morse code transmitter that converts text input from a PS2 keyboard into Morse code. The system outputs Morse sequences via audio and visual (LED) signals. Features include real-time ASCII to Morse code translation, precise timing control for signal integrity, and dual-modality output for comprehensive Morse code communication. The project included extensive simulation and testing to ensure accuracy and reliability in Morse code generation. Suitable for educational purposes or practical Morse applications.
